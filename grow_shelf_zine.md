# Window-Sill LED Grow Shelf
### GridBeam Edition (v4.1)
![Rendered model](grow_shelf_transparent.png)
Modular indoor garden built from wood, light, and logic.

## 1 — What This Is
![Rendered model](grow_shelf_render.png)

A two-level herb garden for any windowsill.  
Built using the GridBeam tri-joint system.  
Each tray holds eight pots; the top tray lights the lower one with 5 V LEDs.  
All parts are re-usable, screw-based, and repairable.

Size: 40x23x46 cm  |  Capacity: 16 pots  |  Power: 5 V DC

## 2 — Why GridBeam
Three beams meet at one node — X, Y, Z — forming a reusable tri-joint.  
GridBeam uses one beam profile, holes every 25 mm, and M5 bolts.  
It’s fast, strong, and circular-economy friendly.

## 3 — Bill of Materials
**Frame**
- 4 m of 18x18 mm pine/beech  
- 4 x 400 mm (X), 4 x 230 mm (Y), 4 x 450 mm (Z)  
- 24 x M5 bolts + nuts + washers  

**Trays & Pots**
- 2 x baking trays (39x23x7 cm)  
- 16 x pots Ø 70 mm x H 80 mm  
- Potting soil  

**Lighting**
- 1 m 5 V red/blue LED strip  
- 5 V 2 A adapter, 22 AWG wire  
- Heat-shrink, solder, digital timer, extension lead

## 4 — Tools
Saw / mitre box • Drill (5 mm) • Screwdriver or spanner  
Solder iron • Heat-gun • Multimeter • Square • Tape • IPA cleaner  

## 5 — Build the Frame
1. Drill holes every 25 mm on beam centerlines (Ø 5 mm).  
2. Bolt base corners: X + Y + Z beams form each tri-joint (3 bolts).  
3. Add upper rails ~ 310 mm above lower tray.  
4. Seat trays flat on beam tops (15 mm wall gap).  

## 6 — Add Pots & Soil
Each tray holds 8 pots (2x4) with ~ 35 mm gap from walls.  
Fill with soil and herbs (basil, mint, thyme).  
Cut drainage holes if using tetra packs.

## 7 — LED Wiring
1. Cut strip to fit tray underside (~ 35 cm runs).  
2. Solder red to +5 V, black to -, join segments with jumpers.  
3. Insulate with heat-shrink; test polarity.  
4. Clean and stick strip under upper tray; glue ends if needed.  
5. Power via adapter -> timer -> wall.  
Set timer: 12–14 h ON (winter) / 8–10 h ON (summer).  

## 8 — Safety & Use
Keep electrics dry; route cables down rear post.  
Tighten bolts monthly, trim plants weekly.  
Optional: foil reflector or PWM dimmer.
